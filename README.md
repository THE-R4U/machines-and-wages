# How Much Money Should Machines Earn?

In this experiment I combine two datasets to create an interactive visualization. Data sets are:
+ The probability of computerisation of 702 detailed occupations, obtained by Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael A. Osborne from the University of Oxford, using a Gaussian process classifier and published [in this paper](https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/downloads/academic/The_Future_of_Employment.pdf) in 2013.
+ Statistics of jobs from (employments, median annual wages and typical education needed for entry) from the US Bureau of Labor, available [here](https://www.bls.gov/emp/ind-occ-matrix/occupation.xlsx).
